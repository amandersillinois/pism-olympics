working on guestimates for the simplest climate for the Olympics simulations

Neet a temperature lapse rate.  This is based on the approximate elevaiton range of the Olympics and the mean annual temperature of Aberdeen, WA (10.5 C) and a lapse rate of ~5 deg C/km from Minder 2010 for the Cascades.  This is less than the wet adiabat (6.5 C/km).    

hmin = 0 m
hmax = 2500 m
Tmax = 10.5 C
Tmin = -2 C




Need a mass balance gradient
Take LaChapelle 1965 long term gradients from Blue glacier
hELA = 1725 m
hmax = 2500 m
hmin = 0m
mmin = -17.25 m/yr
mmax = 5.425 m/yr

based on this relationship

b_bar = 0.007(z-1725) for Z greaterthanequalto 1725
b_bar = -0.010(1725-z) for Z less than 1725
